# testableSGT

This is an intro test repo, to show a simple code base. For git commands you can
see : https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf

For git security
setup: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

This will be a testable code base where some introduction java code will live. Intro code:

* Hello world + input args output initial
* Basic variables intro class
* Primitive variable data type handling
* Initial casting of variable types

<b>homework Description:</b>

Create a new class (name as you think is the best OR you can also use the ReferenceVariables class). This class should hold 3 pre-defined variables
that are the values to convert metric to imperial measurements. This class should have a constructor(
s) - generate them using InteliJ IDEA built in actions (right-click in class -> generate ->
constructor -> select fields for constructor -> ok)
. Write functions that convert metrics. They should just be public void and print out the results,
each function receives a numeric value of the value to be converted. In main method create the new
class object with constructor passing the needed values, call the conversion functions. If you want
a bigger challenge - you can add more variables and functions conversions.
