    1) The incoming data should be organized as an array of numbers.
    2) Convert the numbers in array to the percentages,
       by summing all the values in the array and for each element in array setting a new value as
       ({value of element} / {total sum of all elements})*100 .
     3) Set up a description of what is shown and one of the axis as the first line(s).
     4) For each element of the input array, print out
        the index of the element and corresponding number of characters representing the percentage value.
     5) The output values showing percentages are consistent with the first line printed axis values.
        For convinience the percentage numbers should be rounded to whole numbers.
